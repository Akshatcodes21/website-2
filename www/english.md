# What?
Meeting about computers, technology and their influence on society

# When?
Every Thursday, 19h

# Where?
Most often in the university building [Mathematikon, Im Neuenheimer Feld 205,
Seminarraum A](anfahrt.html). Use the map or QR codes to find your way.

Every first Thursday of a month we [meet in a random restaurant](stammtisch.html)
(„Stammtisch“). [Please RSVP](yarpnarp.html) a couple of days in advance, so
that we can book a suitable table. It’s pretty simple, just enter your nick
and click “yarp”. Be sure to check the site again before you go, sometimes we
need to choose a different place if there's too many people.

You can join either – both are suitable for newcomers.

# Language barrier
There's no denying the main language of the meetings, talks and such is
German. Don't turn away just yet, because almost everyone speaks English.
We can't guarantee you'll feel home right off the bat, but we'll sure try
to include you.

See you soon!
